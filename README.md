# Integrated-Navigation-for-Aircraft-using-Kalman-Filter

Design an integrated navigation system that combines GPS, IMU, and air-data inputs. The system model should encompass 12 states including position, velocity, attitude, and wind components, along with 6 inputs and 12 measurements. We will use the Extended Kalman filter design to estimate the states.
