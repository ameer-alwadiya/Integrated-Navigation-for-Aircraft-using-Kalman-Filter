# Integrated-Navigation-for-Aircraft-using-Kalman-Filter

Design an integrated navigation system that combines GPS, IMU, and air-data inputs. The system model encompasses 12 states, including position, velocity, attitude, and wind components, along with 6 inputs and 12 measurements. The Extended Kalman Filter design is used to estimate the states, remove sensor noise, and detect faults.
